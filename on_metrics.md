Theres a math concept about metrics, look up a video for context to my half remembered conspects; I want types that I want to do math things with to have some set of functions defined; I do just need lerp defined to do what I wanted with lerplist

* isbullshit; floats nan, and other invalid values

* lerp

* bullshitof

* +,-

* \* and a safe devide(?... maybe but how to you divide colors)

* distence

* normalize

Maybe spilt list into two part for simple metrics and advanced ones?
